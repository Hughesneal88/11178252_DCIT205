### README.md
This is a ten page website built in <b>*html*</b>, <b>*css*,</b> and <b>*javascript*</b> for the computer science department. \
The routing and templating are built in <b>ReactJS</b>

Each page is a component on its own with other smaller components also in play.

This site is powered by <b>NodeJS</b>

One notable addition is the complaint form page, which streamlines the course complaint form process, reducing the manual steps involved. The awards page showcases recognitions offered by the computer science department, with the Best Computer Science Award being the most prestigious. The update also includes information on various courses offered by the department, such as programming, Java development, machine learning, and more.

Web development is a crucial field that revolves around creating and maintaining websites and web applications. Its significance lies in its global reach, allowing individuals and businesses to connect with a vast audience worldwide via the internet.

The website also details undergraduate courses in computer science and information technology. Computer science is a comprehensive field encompassing the theory, development, and application of software systems and computing technologies. It covers diverse topics, including algorithm design, programming languages, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, data structures, and software engineering.

Key areas within computer science involve designing efficient algorithms, utilizing programming languages, understanding computer architecture, and developing artificial intelligence and machine learning systems.

Additionally, the website features pages about the university and its commitment to education and research. The University of Ghana, a prominent public institution in Africa, impacts individuals, the region, and the world through education and research. With more than 38,000 students, approximately 2.64% of whom are computer science students, the university strives to address global challenges and provide students with diverse learning opportunities.

For those interested in distance learning, the website highlights the UG-CDCD classroom experience, offering real-time lectures and personal interactions with professors through various online delivery options. This flexible approach maintains academic rigor while accommodating students' schedules.



You can run the site in development mode by typing in the command 
```
npm start
```

## WHAT I LEARNT
- I learnt don't trust the lecturer when he says use react when you know in your heart that you have not learnt it.
- I learnt that code can tricky so, edit in small bits
